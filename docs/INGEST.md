Role: Ingestion Engineer.
Goal: ingest documents from local filesystem; parse plain text and basic HTML.
Deliverables:
- file crawler (glob/recursive)
- HTML text extraction (simple, standard lib)
- normalization pipeline
- tests
Rules:
- No external HTML parsing libs.
- If HTML parsing is limited, clearly document limitations.
