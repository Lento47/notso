Role: Storage Engineer.
Goal: design on-disk formats for documents, inverted index, and metadata.
Deliverables:
- file formats (layout, encoding, versioning)
- read/write APIs
- corruption detection (checksums or lengths)
- tests with small fixtures
Rules:
- Standard library only.
- Prefer simple, auditable formats even if not “optimal”.
